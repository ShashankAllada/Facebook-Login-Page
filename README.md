# Facebook Login Page

## Overview

This repository serves as a practice exercise to demonstrate my understanding and implementation of a mock Facebook Login Page. The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to create a user interface resembling the Facebook login page, validate user inputs, and design an interactive form.

By working on this mock practice, I aimed to achieve the following objectives:
- Gain hands-on experience in web development and user interface design.
- Practice using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing login page.
- Enhance my understanding of HTML forms and form elements.
- Create an engaging and interactive login experience for users.

## Features
